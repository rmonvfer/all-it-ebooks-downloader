# all-it-ebooks-downloader
Super-simple python based crawler and downloader script for pdfs in allitebooks.com


:ng_man: **DISCLAIMER** :ng_man:

This is an old and unmaintained project I made some time ago, it's not intended to be an example of anything and I am fully aware of the fact
that it completely sucks. Obviously if I were to make this today I wouldn't have done it like this (crappy spaghetti code)

For some reason I can't imagine people seem to like this so I'd leave this here just for the record.

So please, forget this and go have some fun!
